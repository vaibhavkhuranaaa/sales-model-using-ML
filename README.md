# Fidelity Magellan Mutual Fund - Investor Conversion Model

This project focuses on building a model to convert prospective investors into investing $10,000 in the Fidelity Magellan mutual fund. The analysis addresses four key questions and provides valuable insights for optimizing mailing quantities and identifying impactful variables. The results of the model are presented, including an alternative cut-point for the prospect universe.

## Project Summary
The main objectives of this project were to:

- Determine if a model could be built to reduce mailing quantities by 25% while maintaining a high response rate.
- Identify the variables used in the model for predicting investment decisions.
- Analyze the most impactful variables and their relationship with the probability of making an investment.
- Explore an alternative cut-point for the prospect universe.

## Results and Findings

1. Mailing Quantity Optimization: By cutting mailing quantities by 25%, the remaining 75% of prospects accounted for 93% of total sales, demonstrating that significant cost savings can be achieved without compromising response rates.

2. Variables Used in the Model: The model included various variables, such as demographic information and spending patterns, to predict investment decisions. Table 1 in the project provides a comprehensive list of these variables.

3. Most Impactful Variables: The variables that had the most significant impact on the probability of making an investment were:
      - Amount of dollars spent on car policies.
      - Percentage of Protestants in the prospect's neighborhood.
      - Number of houses owned by the prospect.
    All these variables showed a positive association with investment decisions.

4. Alternative Cut-Point: An alternative cut-point at 55% of the prospect universe was identified using lift analysis.
This cut-point accounted for 83% of sales, demonstrating the possibility of reducing mailing quantities further while still achieving a substantial response rate.

## Conclusion
The developed model provides valuable insights into optimizing prospect conversion for the Fidelity Magellan mutual fund. By reducing mailing quantities by 25% and focusing on the most impactful variables, significant cost savings can be achieved without sacrificing response rates. The alternative cut-point analysis offers additional opportunities for optimization.

This project serves as a valuable resource for marketing and sales teams aiming to improve their prospect targeting strategies and increase the success rate of investment conversions.
